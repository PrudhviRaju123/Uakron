This is the Draft version of the Uakron mobile app. Only UI is done and backend logic for few modules are yet to be implemented 

**App Main Page:**
The foremost feature everyone loves about the leading apps in the market is about customization available within the app. Since different people have their own likes for main app page, I have used preferences to provide different screens to be set according to the user taste

A Single app can have N number of different main pages .Few of them are shown below and the first one  is using navigation browser (used in gmail etc. ) and the second one is a grid view showing  available features in the app

**Home:** This feature  can be used for viewing  springboard messages, grade alerts..etc [Not yet started]
